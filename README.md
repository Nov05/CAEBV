**Chronic active EBV infection** or in its expanded form, **chronic active Epstein–Barr virus infection** is a very rare and often fatal complication of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection that most often occurs in children or adolescents of Asian or South American lineage, although cases in Hispanics, Europeans and Africans have been reported.[1] It is classified as one of the Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases (i.e. EBV+ LPD).[2]

**The probability of survival at 5 years after disease onset** was 0.59 for patients with T-cell CAEBV and 0.87 for those with NK-cell CAEBV. In our study, at 5 years after the onset of disease, 66% of patients with T-cell CAEBV were alive and 73% of those with B-cell CAEBV were alive.

Chronic active Epstein–Barr virus infection (CAEBV) is a prototype of the EBV-associated T- or NK-cell lymphoproliferative diseases, which also include hypersensitivity to mosquito bites and severe-type hydroavacciniforme. The manifestations of CAEBV are often self-limiting with minimum supportive care or only prednisolone and cyclosporine A with or without etoposide. However, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only cure, without which patients with CAEBV die within several years. A severe hypercytokinemia and hemophagocytic syndrome, which may occur suddenly, often results in a fatal clinical course. At out institute, we have established a 3-step strategy, including allogeneic HSCT, for the treatment of CAEBV. Seventy-nine patients with CAEBV and related diseases have been treated to date. The 3-year overall survival rate (3y-OS) is currently 87.3 ± 4.2% after planned allogeneic HSCT. However, 3y-OS in patients with uncontrolled active disease is only 16.7 ± 10.8%. To maximize survival rates with minimized late sequelae, we recommend earlier initiation and completion of the 3-step treatment without watchful waiting. We present six illustrative and difficult cases (including severe hypercytokinemia or emergent HSCT) and discuss them together with 73 residual cases.

**STAT3 can be a therapeutic target for chronic active EBV infection, a fatal disorder**

Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection (CAEBV) is an inflammatory disorder with potential for tumor development. Here, unusual phosphorylation was observed on STAT3 in EBV-infected T- or NK-cells from patients with CAEBV. Researchers found that ruxolitinib, a drug that is currently used for treatment of myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera, could suppress the survival of these EBV-infected cells in a dose-dependent manner, and that STAT3 could be an important new target for treatment of CAEBV.

**Epstein-Barr virus and skin**    

In adolescents and young adults, EBV infections often result in an IM. They get the infection through transmission of oropharingeal secretions and, after incubation period (30-50 days), the disease is expressed clinically in more than 70% of exposed adolescents.9 It is an autolimited lymphoproliferative disease, with several days of fever (2 - 3 weeks), pharyngitis associated with exudate (30% cases) and cervical adenopathies. During prodomal phase, the patient presents weakness, anorexia, fatigue, headache and fever. The presence of splenomegaly is variable, detectable on the physical examination in more than 17% and in radiological imaging in almost 100%. The infrequent manifestations include obstruction of the airways, abdominal pain, rash, jaundice, hepatomegaly and eyelid edema. The cutaneous lesions are present in approximately 5% of the patients; the rash can be macular, petechial, scarlatiniform, urticariform or erythema multiforme type.9 In 90 to 100% of patients consuming ampicillin on the previous 10 days, a maculopapular exanthema is evident. Some cases with amoxylin and beta-lactam antibiotics have also been described. In most of IM patients, the disease is caused by an EBV primary infection but similar symptoms can occur in cytomegalovirus infection and a syndrome caused by hypersensitivity to sulfones, anticonvulsants, allopurinol and other drugs. IM complications are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, splenic rupture, airways obstruction by tonsillar hypertrophy, central nervous system impairment and fulminant hepatitis.

**Lipschutz ulcers, also known as ulcus vulvae acutum:** Concerning the ethiology, although there is evidence demonstrating that acute genital ulcer can be a EBV primary infection manifestation, there are published cases associating it to other infections like cytomegalovirus, influenza A virus, influenza B virus and adenovirus, mumps virus, Salmonella paratyphi, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Lyme disease.10 It is believed that the ulceration is due to an EBV viremia complication during acute infection, which arrive to genitals via lymphocytic infiltration, blood circulation, or autoinoculation with saliva or cervicovaginal fluid. Once in the genital mucosa, one of the following mechanisms produces the ulceration: cytotoxic immune response, deposition of immunocomplexes or direct cytolysis, consequence of the viral replication in the wall and endothelium of blood vessels. That would produce a lymphocytic vasculitis or, finally, a cytolysis process due to EBV replication in keratinocytes with a reactive inflammatory response secondary to the liberation of particles in the stroma.
