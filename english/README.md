Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection of T- and NK-cell type, systemic form (referred to hereafter as simply CAEBV) is incor-porated into the revised WHO 2016 classification scheme within the section of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)–positive T cell and NK-cell lymphoproliferative diseases of childhood.1 Complete characteriza-tion of CAEBV has eluded physicians and researchers for decades due to its variable clinical presentations and rates of progression, pathologic overlap with other infectious and inflammatory diseases and systemic lymphomas, a propensity for EBV to infect T-, B-, and NK-cell types, and inconsistent molecular findings that included poly-, oligo-, and monoclonal lymphoproliferations. Despite this het-erogeneity, it is important to recognize CAEBV as early as possible in its course, because the disease is intractable and progressive, and a few large series report an all-cause mortality of 30%-44% after 46-68 months, even with varying rates of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant.2-4 We present a patient case of CAEBV, and re-view the history of this unusual disease, its classification and patho-logic features, and current themes in pathogenesis and management.

**Defining the elusive boundaries of chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection**  

Chronic active EBV is characterized by EBV+ T- or NK-cell proliferations and includes systemic as well as cutaneous forms. Systemic CAEBV presents with fever, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, and typically develops in immunocompetent patients following primary EBV infection. The initial phase resembles an IM-like illness. These lymphoid proliferations may be polyclonal, oligoclonal or monoclonal, and have a propensity to evolve into a systemic EBV+ T- or NK-cell lymphoma. CAEBV most often occurs in children and adolescents without a history of immunodeficiency or autoimmunity. The clinical course and prognosis of CAEBV is highly variable: while some patients exhibit a protracted disease course, others experience a fulminant form of the disease accompanied by HLH.1–3,8–10

Chronic active EBV of T- and NK-cell types have a strong ethnic predisposition, and are most frequent in East Asia and in indigenous populations of Central and South America.1,6–11 It is rare in Western and African populations.1,13 The etiology of CAEBV is unknown, although susceptibility is thought to result from defective cytotoxic T-cell or NK-cell activity against EBV-infected cells. In addition to a defective host immune response, EBV viral load is a key factor that impacts the severity of the disease.1,2 Rare CAEBV cases with EBV+ B-cell proliferations have also been reported in Asia and in the United States.2,13 Although CAEBV typically affects children and adolescents, rare cases of adult-onset CAEBV have been reported; these are associated with a worse prognosis.1,2

Severe allergy to mosquito bites is an NK-cell proliferation that results from local and systemic symptoms following a mosquito bite. Immunophenotypic features, particularly CD30 expression in a subset may overlap with features of lymphomatoid papulosis.1,2,9,17 **Recognition and timely diagnosis is important because patients with severe allergy to mosquito bites may progress to systemic NK-cell type CAEBV, aggressive NK-cell leukemia, or ENKTL.17** In comparison to pediatric onset CAEBV, the adult cohort analyzed by Kawamoto et al. had significantly lower frequency of fever and greater frequency of skin lesions, including HV-LPD and severe allergy to mosquito bites.12
