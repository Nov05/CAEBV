Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection of T- and NK-cell type, systemic form (referred to hereafter as simply CAEBV) is incor-porated into the revised WHO 2016 classification scheme within the section of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)â€“positive T cell and NK-cell lymphoproliferative diseases of childhood.1 Complete characteriza-tion of CAEBV has eluded physicians and researchers for decades due to its variable clinical presentations and rates of progression, pathologic overlap with other infectious and inflammatory diseases and systemic lymphomas, a propensity for EBV to infect T-, B-, and NK-cell types, and inconsistent molecular findings that included poly-, oligo-, and monoclonal lymphoproliferations. Despite this het-erogeneity, it is important to recognize CAEBV as early as possible in its course, because the disease is intractable and progressive, and a few large series report an all-cause mortality of 30%-44% after 46-68 months, even with varying rates of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant.2-4 We present a patient case of CAEBV, and re-view the history of this unusual disease, its classification and patho-logic features, and current themes in pathogenesis and management.
